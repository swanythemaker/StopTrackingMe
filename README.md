# STOPTRACKINGME

**Strip the tracking out of your photos — in your browser, before you share them.**

Photos carry more than pixels. EXIF timestamps, GPS coordinates, camera serials, editing
history, and content-credential signatures all ride along inside the file. STOPTRACKINGME
removes them, then **proves** the result is clean before it lets you download.

Everything runs locally. No uploads, no accounts, no servers. Your image never leaves the tab.

## Why it's different

Most "metadata removers" delete what they recognize and hand you the file. STOPTRACKINGME is
**fail-closed**: it re-encodes a fresh image from raw pixels, strips every non-essential
chunk, then **re-audits the output bytes**. If anything questionable survives, the download is
blocked — you never get a file that wasn't verified.

- **No uploads.** All processing happens in a Web Worker on your machine.
- **No network.** The production build ships a Content-Security-Policy that blocks every
  outbound connection.
- **Fail-closed.** Output is released only after it passes a strict audit.
- **Deterministic.** Decode, pixel edits, stripping and audit run inside a single audited
  WebAssembly core, so the cleaned output is byte-for-byte identical in every browser — and the
  strip and audit read one shared allowlist, so they can never disagree.
- **Honest about limits.** It tells you exactly what it removed — and what it can't.

## How it works

1. Drop or pick a PNG, JPEG, or WebP.
2. Our own WebAssembly core decodes it to raw pixels — not the browser's native decoder — so the
   result is the same everywhere, with EXIF orientation baked in before the tag is dropped.
3. Any edits you chose (resize, rotate, flip) are applied to those pixels.
4. A fresh file is re-encoded, then the same core strips every non-essential chunk and marker.
5. The output is re-scanned by the same parser. If it isn't provably clean, download is refused.
6. You download a verified-clean copy.

The input scan reporting **FAIL** is normal — it's flagging the metadata in your *original*.
Only the **output** scan decides whether the download is allowed.

## What gets removed

| Format | Kept | Removed |
|--------|------|---------|
| **PNG**  | `IHDR`, `PLTE`, `IDAT`, `IEND`, `tRNS` | `tEXt`, `zTXt`, `iTXt`, `eXIf`, `iCCP`, and all unknown chunks |
| **JPEG** | image & structural segments | `APP0`–`APP15`, `COM` (EXIF, XMP, JFIF, comments) |
| **WebP** | `VP8 `, `VP8L`, `VP8X`, `ALPH` | `EXIF`, `XMP `, `ICCP`, animation chunks |

This covers EXIF (including GPS), XMP/IPTC, JPEG app/comment markers, PNG text and private
chunks, WebP metadata chunks, and C2PA / content-credential provenance signatures.

## Ultra Paranoid mode (default on)

Forces PNG output, disables lossy controls, and applies the strictest checks. PNG is a simpler
container with fewer metadata edge-cases, so the fail-closed audit can be more certain. PNG is
lossless, so the cleaned file is sometimes *larger* than the original — that's expected.

## Resize, rotate, flip — into the clean copy

An optional **Adjust** panel lets you downscale (75 / 50 / 25 %, or a custom percentage), rotate
90°, or flip. Edits are applied to the decoded pixels *before* re-encode, so the edited image still
passes the exact same strip + audit — the cleaned file is the edited one, in a single step. The
resampling is done in WebAssembly (not the browser's canvas), so it's reproducible.

Downscaling resamples every pixel, which also disrupts pixel-domain steganography and shifts
perceptual hashes — it *reduces* what can survive, but it is **not** a steganography guarantee.
Defaults are identity (100 %, no rotation), so the one-drop-clean path is unchanged.

## What it can't do

This is metadata and provenance removal, not magic. It **cannot** guarantee removal of:

- steganography hidden inside the pixel values themselves
- visible watermarks
- anything leaked by a compromised browser or operating system

It also depends on your runtime being intact. When in doubt, it fails closed.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:8888
```

## Build & test

```bash
npm run build       # type-check + production bundle
npm run build:wasm  # rebuild the Rust sanitize-core wasm (needs Rust + wasm-pack; output is committed)
npm run test:e2e    # zero-network + cross-engine determinism + the edit tools
cargo test --manifest-path sanitize-core/Cargo.toml   # the core's own contract tests
```

Two contracts back the promise: the e2e test watches every network request during a real sanitize
and fails if a single byte tries to leave the page; the core's tests prove that stripped output
always passes the audit, and that malformed input fails closed without crashing.

## Roadmap

- **Stego-risk-reduction mode** — aggressive downscale, requantization, and stricter
  re-encode profiles to disrupt hidden payloads (reduces survivability; never a guarantee).
- **Crop** — cut an edge that's leaking a sign, a timestamp, or a bystander.
- **Multi-codec verification** — encode/decode through independent engines and fail on
  pixel-hash mismatches.
- **Batch / multi-file** processing under the same fail-closed rules.
- **Local sanitization report** — input/output hashes, policy profile, and audit decisions.

Same principle throughout: do more, but never weaken the promise that nothing leaves your tab.
